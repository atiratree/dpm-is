	- "Source" will be called folder with Scripts (as in https://github.com/suomiy/dpm-is/tree/master/SourceCode)
	
	
1. Create Google Calendar called "Rozpisy", set respective time-zone and set this calendar public

2. Create Google Site (you can design it as you want later, here will be described only structure)

3. Set sharing of Sites as "Specific people can access". 

4. Go to Site -> Manage Site -> Apps Scripts . You have to copy all scripts except CalendarAndFilesScheduler here.
	scripts will be here described as 
		x) script $FILENAME
		
	Algorithm for creating scripts
		1) add new script
		2) name it as $FILENAME
		3) copy all files from Source/$FILENAME/* to this script with same extensions		
		5) "todo" specified in each script
		
	a) script "ObjDB" 
		- todo	
			1) remember(copy) $ObjDBId located in ide -> menu -> project properties -> project key
	b) script "Utils" 
		- todo	
			1) add ObjDB with id $ObjDBId to Libraries
			2) ide -> manage versions -> save new version
			3) remember(copy) $UtilsId located in ide -> menu -> project properties -> project key
			4) ide -> project properties -> script properties -> set these values: 
				{Site: *url of your site,
				 logSize: 10000, // maximum number of rows used for logging in spreadsheet
				 CacheTime: 300000, // cache time of user's permission 
				 DatabaseSSid: *ID of spreadsheet Database,
				 SpecialResourceID: *ID of file SpecialResource,
				 storageID: *ID of folder Storage,
				 TimetablesID: *ID of folder Timetables,
				 LogSSid: *ID of spreadsheet Log }
			  - IMPORTANT! files with * will be mentioned later. ~~You can change script properties later anytime~~ Script properties are chached now and should be versioned and each new version coppied to getCachedScriptProperties function in Utils#Utils
			  
	Do this for the rest of the scripts
		- todo	
			1) add Utils with id $UtilsId to Libraries
			2) ide -> manage versions -> save new version
			3) ide -> deploy as web app (execute as user accessing the web app, access has anyone within $DOMAIN)
	c) script "Create"		
	d) script "Delete" 
	e) script "SheetRedirect" 
	f) script "StatisticsAndBillingRedirect" 
	g) script "TableScript" 
		you have to setup published url's of scripts Update and Delete in ButtonUtils.gs -> htmlManager.deleteScriptUrl and htmlManager.editScriptUrl
	h) script "Update" 	
		
5. Go to Site -> Manage Site -> Attachments and put here gif you wish to use for loading. 
	1) go to scripts Create, Delete, Update and StatisticsAndBillingRedirect
	2) find main.html
	3) replace attribute src of these elements <img id='loader'> with link of this gif
	
6. Create pages. Structure of them and it's content will be described here
	Inserting scripts is done this ways: sites ide -> edit page ->  insert -> apps script
	
	Inserting TableScript is done this way: sites ide -> edit page ->  insert -> Apps Script
    uncheck and clear all values	
				
	All pages should have permission to access decided by top-level page
